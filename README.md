# _Project Microwave_
#### This project has been created for the course "Human-Computer Interaction" which is taught in the fall semester of Computer Science in Athens University of Economics and Business.
##### In collaboration with my classmate _Hilsen Cenaj_, we built this Android app which is a friendly interface for a microwave. Of course, it doesn't connect with a microwave in reality but the course helps you build the interface appropriately for all kinds of people. The purpose of this app is to be handled by people with no experience in technology and/or have mild vision loss. Also, the main language of the app is greek.
##### The app is split into 3 stages. Each stage has a button for instructions that can be heard and a microphone button that user can use it according to the instructions.1st stage is the first screen that the user can see and via buttons can continue to the next stages. In the 2nd stage, the user can select and edit the preferable program. The 3rd stage is a review of what the user has selected and completed the process.
#### We have uploaded a [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llFdg9k4hkk) in which there are instructions on how to use the application

###### There is also a PDF file with instructions in _greek_ named [_report.pdf_](https://github.com/fwteinhpap/Microwave/blob/master/Report.pdf) .
