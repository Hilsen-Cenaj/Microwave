# _Project Microwave_
#### This project has been created for the course "Human-Computer Interaction" which is taught in the fall semester of Information Technology in Athens University of Economics and Business.
##### In collaboration with my classmate-_Hilsen Cenaj_ ,we built this *Android* app which is a friendly interface for a microwave. Of course it doesn't really connect with a microwave but the course helps you building the interface appropriately for all kind of people. The aim was this app can be handled from people with no experience in technology and/or have minor blindness. Also, the main language of app is *greek*.
##### The app is splitted into _3 stages_. Each stage has a button for instructions that can be heard and a microphone button that user can use it according to the instructions.1st stage is the first screen that user can see and via buttons can continue to next stages. In 2nd stage, user can select the preferable program and edit this.The 3rd stage is a review of what user has selected and completing the process.
#### We have uploaded a [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llFdg9k4hkk) in which there are instructions how to use the application

###### There is also a PDF file with instructions in _greek_ named _report.pdf_ .
